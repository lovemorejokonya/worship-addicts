        	<h1>MSU Praise & Worship Sermina - <span>12-03-2016</span></h1>
        	<div class="news-description">
            	<span>Midlands State University</span> recently organised a Praise and Worship Sermina and invited Takesure Ncube as a guest speaker. It has always been at the heart of Worship Addicts to grow music ministers who have a heart for ministry and seek to give people God. This means developing ministers, rather than just eloquent performers. The recent sermina was one step towards that goal. Looking forward to many more.
